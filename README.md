Hi, I’m Cade Knoeppel

I’m an Information Science student at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee with a focus on penetration testing and offensive security. I’m currently building hands-on experience through structured labs and technical writeups that demonstrate real-world attack paths and security weaknesses.

Areas of Focus
- Web application security and common vulnerabilities
- Linux and Windows privilege escalation
- Enumeration and exploitation methodology
- Practical learning through TryHackMe labs

Current Work
- Developing a penetration testing portfolio with documented lab writeups
- Strengthening fundamentals in networking, Linux, and security tooling
- Applying offensive security concepts in controlled, legal environments
