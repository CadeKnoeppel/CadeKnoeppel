# Hi, I’m Cade Knoeppel

I’m an Information Science student at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee with a focus on penetration testing and offensive security. I build hands-on experience through structured security labs and detailed technical writeups that demonstrate real-world attack paths, exploitation techniques, and privilege escalation scenarios.

## Technical Focus
- Web application security (SQL injection, XSS, authentication flaws)
- Linux and Windows privilege escalation
- Network and service enumeration
- Exploitation methodology and post-exploitation analysis
- Hands-on offensive security labs in controlled environments

## Current Work
- Developing a penetration testing portfolio with documented lab writeups
- Strengthening fundamentals in networking, Linux, and security tooling
- Expanding into more complex Windows and Active Directory environments
