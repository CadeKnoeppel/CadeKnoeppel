## Hi, I’m Cade Knoeppel

I’m an Information Science student at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee with a focus on penetration testing and offensive security. I’m building hands-on experience through structured security labs and technical writeups that demonstrate real-world attack paths and common security weaknesses.

### Technical Focus
- Web application security (SQL injection, XSS, authentication flaws)
- Linux and Windows privilege escalation
- Enumeration and exploitation methodology
- Practical offensive security labs using TryHackMe

### Current Work
- Developing a penetration testing portfolio with documented lab writeups
- Strengthening fundamentals in networking, Linux, and security tooling
- Expanding into more complex Windows and Active Directory environments
